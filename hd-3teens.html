      Half Dome with 3 kids, 6/3/17
    </h4>
<p>
Teenagers: the best kept secret in parenting.

After making tens of billions of babies, we still can't decide if the
wrinkled little noise makers should sleep pudgy belly up or down.  Ask
any two [Bay Area] parents if precalculus should be a preschool
prerequisite or just accelerated in kindergarten and you'll get three
vehemently argued, scientifically proven, diametrically opposing
opinions. The only universally agreed among parental creed is that
teenagers are nightmares.

<p>
Nothing could be further from the truth.

<p>
Yes, some teenagers are tough. And some parents are awful. Big
deal. The vast majority of teens rock! Or at least the teens I'm
exposed to -- nerds, climbers, and nerdy climbers.

<p>
There's something magical about every age. The toddler learning to
walk and run, although not necessarily in that order. The sponge like
language skills of the 2-6 year old.  The hilarious questions of the
7-10 year old. The awful puns of the 11-12 year old. But nothing
entertains like the teen. They are wickedly funny, smart, talented,
and clueless.

<p>
That dichotomy of insane talent and complete cluelessness could not be more perfectly
captured than in this photo of the Tim and Ross show taking on the long, uniform cracks of
Moab with a single #1 red camalot!

<p><img src="hd-3teens/ross-tim-cam.jpg"><p>

Tim and Ross are two of the nicest, strongest, and most talented bay
area youth crushers. And yet totally clueless. Look carefully on
Ross' left for their "desert rack". For reference, here is Connor's
Moab rack:

<p><img src="hd-3teens/connor-rack.jpg"><p>

Tim and Ross are crazy strong boulders. Nevertheless, sick crimp
strength and a #1 red camalot isn't always sufficient for desert cracks
requiring a dozen of the same size pieces:

<p><img src="hd-3teens/connor-quarterman.jpg"><p>

The Tim and Ross single #1 red camalot photo sent me into an existential tail
spin. Sitting back and watching a major epic slowly unfold is what I
live for. See Cris and her zero preparation for El Cap. Or Eric and
any climb. Or Rob and life. Any yet, I couldn't help myself. Tim and
Ross are just too nice. I had to launch an intervention. Unable to
resist preventing the comic epic that would have been the Tim and Ross
crack climbing show, rocked me to my core. But it's just that I have
way too much baggage from not having intervened early with another
talented redheaded climbing goofball:

<p><img src="hd-3teens/greg-pipes.jpg"><p>

    Jim: <i>"I'm thinking of taking Tim and Ross up Half Dome."</i><p>

    Anne: <i>"Why would you do that?"</i><p>

    Jim: <i>"Because they went to Moab with a single #1 red camalot."</i><p>

    Anne: <i>"So?"</i><p>

    Jim: "<i>It's not like these trip reports write themselves. At least not since
      <a href = "robbed.html" target="_blank"> Rob refuses to climb with me.</a>"</i><p>

    Anne: <i>"Good trip report material isn't a reason to take boulderers up Half Dome!"</i><p>


    Jim: <i> "They're young. There's still time to correct their juvenile
      missteps. Bouldering can be eradicated if caught early enough."</i><p>

    Anne: <i>"Ross has never climbed a multi-pitch climb."</i><p>

    Jim: <i>"Tim has climbed one. He can teach Ross."</i><p>

    Anne: <i>"Oh, for goodness' sake! Just take Kara along so at least you'll
have some adult supervision."</i><p>

There's the old joke: Men marry hoping their wives never change. Women
marry hoping their husbands will. Both are disappointed. In our case,
it's not disappointment. It's just quiet exasperation on Anne's part.
After 30 years of marriage, Anne just shook her head in dismay
that I thought it a good idea to take three teens -- two totally
clueless boulderers -- up Half Dome for a first multi-pitch climb.

<p>
While Anne's grown accustomed to -- which should in no way be confused
for the embracing of -- my climbing brainstorms over these past 30
years, Ross' mom, Paige, has not.

<p>
Although not a climber, Paige has been around climbing and Ross long
enough that Half Dome as a first climb did set off some maternal
alarms. Not a problem. <a href="../lor.html" target="_blank">Erika's Letter of Recommendation</a> has
saved me from innumerable tense concerned parent conversations and
Child Protective Services hearings. So when Paige awkwardly asked if I
was remotely qualified to take two inexperience teens up Half Dome, I,
once again, ducked behind Erika's letter. I sent Paige Erika's letter
to assuage her concerns. Kind of a shame too. Paige is such a nice
woman. She was just desperate for some plausible deniability and all I
could come up with was Erika's letter. Sorry about that Paige.  It's
just that I get a perverse joy in taking down other parents with me.
Watching the quick thinking Jim Rogers try to desperately backpedal
is still one of my all time favorites:

<p><img src="hd-3teens/jimrogers-fb.jpg"><p>

And so with two clueless boulderers and Kara -- who rescheduled her
finals to bail out her dad once again -- we headed to the Valley.

<p>
If only a great positive attitude alone could get you up Half
Dome. The boys' attitude and psyched was pinned. But the conversation
on the drive up was worrisome. Tim's animated description of enduring
the [1/2 mile flat] hike to Tuolumne's Drug Dome bouldering was not
reassuring. We were about to start a 3 hour, 2000' elevation gain hike
up the Death Slabs in direct sun. But more worrisome, and fascinating,
was the indefatigable illogic of the teenage brain. Tim and his two
loopyhead bouldering buddies turned a 7 hour drive to Bishop this
winter into a 16 hour all night epic. With a winter storm brewing,
they couldn't be bothered to check their phones for road conditions
because, well, it's difficult to get teens interested in their phones.
So they drove up hwy 120 to the pass to find it closed. Undeterred,
and not bothering to check their phones again for road conditions,
they drove up hwy 108 to the pass to find it closed.  Same with hwy 4.
That teens would gratuitously add 9 hours to a 7 hour drive rather
than check their phones, all for an hour winter night bouldering
session in Bishop, is fairly typical of the teenage brain. The
worrisome part was that Tim spent most of the drive to the Valley
defending it?! He tried to argue that driving passed the flashing
"PASS CLOSED" sign was totally reasonable because the gates down low
were open. Huh??? While I'm fascinating by the workings of the teenage
mind, this was not at all a reassuring bit of reasoning from the kid
who was about to belay me up a 2000' wall!

<p>
Having my confidence in the wisdom of taking three teens up Half Dome badly
shaken, we headed up the Death Slabs.

<p><img src="hd-3teens/start-hike.jpg"><p>

Tim's big wall packing did nothing to restore my rapidly diminishing confidence:

<p><img src="hd-3teens/tim-packing.jpg"><p>

But the kids pounded up the the Death Slabs in color coordinated style.

<p><img src="hd-3teens/ross-slabs.jpg"><p>

Until we hit two of the scariest sights in the Yosemite backcountry -- a bear and a boulderer!

<p><img src="hd-3teens/ross-bear.jpg"><p>

That taking a <a href = "jniad-connor.html" target="_blank">7th grader up El Capitan without jumars</a> was the
training run for taking the Tim and Ross show up Half Dome says all
you need to know about boulderers. Yet, even with all my meticulous
mental training for dealing with boulderers, I was pushed to dig
deep. Real deep. The teenage mutant boulderers ogling every 5ft pebble
for a "sick crimp!" on the approach while oblivious to the towering
2000ft gorgeous granite face right smack in front of them brought me to
the brink. I finally lost it when they found the "sick pinch!" on the
snow cave at the base!

<p><img src="hd-3teens/snow-bouldering.jpg"><p>

Fortunately, the bouldering addled knuckleheads finally glanced up and
noticed the most magnificent granite face in the world; the sheer
Northeast face of Half Dome!

<p><img src="hd-3teens/kids-base.jpg"><p>

We bivied at the base although the relentless mosquitoes nixed any
actual sleeping. I was too lazy to pack a stove so I brought some
quiche for breakfast.  And this is why I love Anne. Without in any
way, shape, or form suggesting three kids on Half Dome was a remotely
good idea, Anne was aghast that I had packed a broccoli quiche for
breakfast rather than a bacon quiche which she insisted is much easier
to get down in the early morning. As usual, Anne was correct. But we
prevailed and choked down the obscenely overpriced Whole Foods broccoli
quiche.

<p><img src="hd-3teens/quiche.jpg"><p>

Almost lost Tim at the base as the icy approach proved to be a
challenging for the boulderer who found the Drug Dome approach
arduous.

<p><img src="hd-3teens/tim-snow-base.jpg"><p>

But such is the wonderful incoherence of the teenager. Yeah, they
couldn't be bothered to check their phones to avoid driving an extra 9
hours to find three passes closed. And yeah, they couldn't help
fondling every "sick dyno" on the nondescript tiny blocks of granite
on the approach while surrounded by all of Yosemite Valley's
transcendent cliffs.  But strap a pair of climbing shoes on these
loopyhead boulderers and watch out!! With zero crack climbing skills,
I had no worries that these kids would crush Half Dome. That's just how
talented they are. My only worry was that they'd embarrass me by
campusing the entire 2000' face.  So while it wasn't bouldering, they
still had a blast crushing it!!!  No matter what Half Dome threw at
them, their smiles never faltered.

<p><img src="hd-3teens/P19-ross.jpg"><p>
<p><img src="hd-3teens/tgl.jpg"><p>

And here's the beauty of the teenage brain. I told them if they walked Thank God Ledge I'd buy them a burrito. So of course the meatballs tried!

<p><img src="hd-3teens/tgl-ross.jpg"><p>
<p><img src="hd-3teens/tgl-tim.jpg"><p>


Purging that bouldering nonsense from their blood proved even more difficult than I had anticipated. Rather than an effortless 5.7 chicken wing:

<p><img src="hd-3teens/P20-kara.jpg"><p>

The mutant boulderers insisted on turning it into a V10 crimp:

<p><img src="hd-3teens/P20-ross.jpg"><p>

Or whatever the heck this only-a-boulderer-would-think-of move is:

<p><img src="hd-3teens/P20-tim.jpg"><p>

But the kids did an awesome job. Crushing 22 gorgeous pitches and having a blast every step of the way.

<p><img src="hd-3teens/summit-kids.jpg"><p>


There's no truer nor more understated parental cliche than they grow up in a flash. It's mind boggling that it's been six years since Kara's first Half Dome!

<p><img src="hd-3teens/summit-6years.jpg"><p>

Topped out at sunset and hiked back to the base. The snow and ice
fields contouring around the front of the Dome made for the most
treacherous part of the day. But since Tim and Ross' parents might
read this trip report, that part has been redacted.

<p>
Finally made it back to the base where our phones lit up from the day's news.

<p>
Anne: <i>"Alex just did the one thing that could make taking three teens up Half Dome look reasonable."</i><p>

Jim: <i>"Alex is a great guy! I owe him."</i><p>

The news of Alex's solo rocked me. A great feat for sure. But it froze
my blood.  A hundred years ago, I stumbled back to the Valley floor
after my first Half Dome which was an epic of Eric proportion.  The
Valley was a buzz with news that Skinner and Piana had freed the
Salathe Headwall. I didn't know what the Salathe nor the Headwall was,
but in my whipped, beaten, broken, post first wall stupor it made an
impression.  It changed the direction of my climbing for the next
decade. I have no worries about Kara. Her head is screwed on
straight. But Tim and Ross are vulnerable. They were willing to risk
it all to walk Thank God Ledge for a soggy burrito. If they ever
entertain free soloing I will never forgive myself for taking them out
of the gym and introducing them to big walls.

<p>
I need not have worried. The next week the greatest El Cap feat of all
time went down: The Naked Nose In A Day!  There is nothing that
captivates the teenage brain like nakedness. Whatever fleeting
delusions of grandeur Tim and Ross might have had about free soloing,
they were long sent packing once they saw this photo:

Had a nice bivy at the base and then scavenged our few remaining nuts
and bars for breakfast before heading off for a nice, relaxing,
casual, hike down the Death Slabs. We were soon to find the reason for
that moniker. For no particular reason, we took the west most fixed
lines down the slabs. It's more direct but the rope is longer and goes
over a bit of loose rock. Ross went first, followed by Kara. Suddenly,
3/4th of the way down Kara stopped? She wasn't complaining, which
she never does, but she wasn't moving, which she also never
does. So I descended the fixed rope to find every parents'
nightmare:

<p><img src="hd-3teens/head-blood.jpg"><p>

A rock from high above had come loose and conked her on the
noggin. Fortunately, it must not have been a large rock. She wasn't
knocked out or dazed which was good as she was hand-over-handing and
not tied into the fixed rope. It could have been worse.
<a href="https://vimeo.com/128935845" target="_blank"> A lot worse.</a>
But it still gave me pause. We quickly turned my nice sleeping bag sheet
liner into a first aid kit and continued down.

<p><img src="hd-3teens/head-bandage.jpg"><p>

I was, however, appalled, at Kara's lack of leave no trace ethic:

<p><img src="hd-3teens/leave-no-trace.jpg"><p>

The tense medical situation required a level head and careful
consideration. I had to triage the high risk stuff first. So when we
got to the Valley floor I feed the hungry teenagers. Then, once feed,
we ambled over to the Yosemite Medical Clinic to sew up Kara's
head. An open head wound is worrisome. But you don't mess with not
feeding hungry teenagers! Eventually, though, Kara's head was stabled closed:

<p><img src="hd-3teens/stables.jpg"><p>

Sure, Anne's sainthood has enabled our marriage to endure, nay,
thrive(!), for 30 years. But it's not like I haven't learned a few things
along the way. I'm way proud of myself for intuitively texting Anne the
stabled up photo of her daughter's head before sending the blood-soaked
head shot! I should probably write a relationship column.
